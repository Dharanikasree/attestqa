 * Credential files, refused by NAME before anything reads them.
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──
 * Run 20260918T221233Z, event 33: the agent called `fs.read_file` on `.env`
 * and got it. The whole file — model key, Azure DevOps PAT, application
 * password — went into the ledger in plaintext, where it stayed, because a
 * ledger is append-only by design.
 *
 * Nothing malfunctioned. The skill tells the agent to take its test account
 * from `AQA_APP_USER` and `AQA_APP_PASS`, so it went looking for the file that
 * defines them: a correct inference from the instructions it was given.
 * `read_file` is policy class `read`, which the default policy EXECUTES, so no
 * gate saw it and no human was asked.
 *
 * That is the argument for removing the capability rather than governing it.
 * A policy says what is allowed and can be set wrong, in a config file, by
 * someone in a hurry; this list is a path the process does not have. The
 * agent never needs these files — the two variable names it may use are in the
 * skill text, and their VALUES reach the tests through the Playwright config's
 * `process.env`, never through the model's context.
 *
 * Refusal covers writing as well as reading: an agent that cannot read `.env`
 * but can overwrite it can still destroy a working checkout, and "write the
 * credentials somewhere I can read them" is a path this closes on the way.
